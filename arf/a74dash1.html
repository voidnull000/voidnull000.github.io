						<b>ATTENTION</b><br>
						THIS ANOMALY IS CURRENTLY NOT CONTAINED.<br>
						PRELIMINARY TESTING SHOWS THAT THIS ANOMALY IS GENERALLY HARMLESS. HOWEVER, CAUTION IS STILL ADVISED. <br>

					<!-- Ignore it. -->
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Details</b><br>
					Anomaly 47-1 (classified as A74-1) is a humanoid organism which appears to possess rational thought. It is a skeletal figure, with strange fleshy tendrils wrapped around itself,
					and its internal organs are exposed. <br>
					A74-1 appears to be sentient, and capable of emotion. It, however, cannot speak. Why this is remains inconclusive, but general tests are underway to understand this issue further. <br>
					<!-- It's because they didn't grow a voicebox. That's still an interesting "why," but it really isn't VERY interesting. -->
					An interesting feature of A74-1 is the color and pattern on its eyeballs. The sclera is bright yellow, whilst the pupil appears to be a deep red. There also appears to be, what 
					can only be described as, triangle shapes above and below the pupil, potentially being its iris.
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Origins</b><br>
					A74-1 was "grown" from A74, emerging from the fleshy surface like a plant. After a careful cleaning and trimming process by
					the research team, A74-1 was subject to immediate capability and sapience tests.
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Touring information</b><br>
					A74-1 is unavailable for tour, due to its recent existence and cataloguing.
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Additional information</b><br>
					If you or your organization would like access to the full report file, please <span class="fakelink">contact us</span>. You are required to have the necessary access details and 
					secure passes.
