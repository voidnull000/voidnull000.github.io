					<h2>Anomaly 47</h2><br>
					<!-- Classification is Axxx, where xxx is the number in reverse order -->
					<!-- i.e. Anomaly 152 would be A251. -->
					
					<b>Details</b><br>
					Anomaly 47 (classified as A74) is a large organism of considerable size. It consists of a large organic surface with a sizeable trunk protuding from it. The trunk looks
					similar to the cardiovascular system of a human being, complete with a contained heart. The "branches" of the organism are made of bone, and the "leaves" are a massive 
					interconnected mass of lungs.<br>
					Tests have determined that the organism extends to at least five meters downward from the visible surface. Whether this mass contains the internal organs is yet to
					be determined.<br>
					Whilst the ARF has not been able to determine if it is capable of rational thought,
					it has been demonstrated to have a brain, and potentially an intelligence of some kind. Further studies are ongoing in order to conclude these questions.<br>
					Despite general anxiety between numerous researchers, the ARF has determined that A74 is safe. While A74 can consume organic material (i.e. bones, organs, skin, dead
					flesh), it has been demonstrated to not consume any living being, especially while wearing clothing.
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Origins</b><br>
					Anomaly 47 was created by notable scientist Nia Laborde, in what they claim was <q>another attempt</q> at making <q>a new species.</q> When asked on details, they 
					claimed that A74 was <q>attempt 12,</q> and was abandoned due to numerous errors in the creation process.<br>
					Said scientist is frequently invited to the ARF facility for questioning and help on feeding. If you see them on your tour, feel free to say hello.
					<!-- DON'T TRUST ATTEMPT 14 -->
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Touring information</b><br>
					Anomaly 47 is available for viewing on tour only during dedicated events (i.e. "Deep Access Week"). Please refer to the <span class="fakelink">tour calender</span> for details and 
					booking dates. Tours consist of a viewing from the 3rd story observation window.<br>
					Access inside of the containment chamber is strictly permitted only to research personnel, due to the risk of contamination, sanitary restrictions, and general
					disease risk.
					
					<br><br>
					
					<b>Additional information</b><br>
					If you or your organization would like access to the full report file, please <span class="fakelink">contact us</span>. You are required to have the necessary access details and 
					secure passes.
