		<h1>how 2: be a passenger</h1>
		<h3>(note: again, there's plenty of stuff that isn't covered here. find a better guide, because this one probably isn't good enough)</h3>
		<br>
		
		<p>Okay, you've arrived at SS14, and you're ready to start playing the game.</p>
		<p>Uh, how DO you play?</p>
		<br>
		<p>When you join the game, you'll be in the lobby. There'll probably be a round on-going, so you'll need to late-join.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Lobby? Round? What?</h2>
		<p>Game time on SS14 is typically cut up into rounds. It typically takes ~1-2 hours for one to end, and in that time you're not allowed to talk about it anywhere else, since that's called Metacomming (or, Metacommunications)</p>
		<p>Late-joining is when you join the game while a round is on-going. Simple, really.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>How do I late join?</h2>
		<p>Press the <b>Join</b> button in the lobby. Then, select the job you want to play.</p>
		<p>Since this is a guide about the <b>Passenger</b> role, pick <b>Passenger</b>.</p>
		
		<h2>I'm in game, now what?</h2>
		<p>Learn. Talk to people, whatever.</p>
		<p>There'll be some random things going on, but don't worry. You'll be fine. <span style="font-size: 6px">Probably.</span></p>
		<p>Some things you need to know:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, <b>Follow the rules.</b></p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The round only ends <b>when the round-end screen appears. Not before.</b></p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>You're probably going to die.</b> Don't worry, this happens to the best of us.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't try to get into places you're not allowed inside. This is called <b>greytiding</b> (or graytiding), and is <b>not okay in the slightest.</b></p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>I died, now what?</h2>
		<p>Now you wait. And wait.</p>
		<p>Know that you have a chance to be put back into the round. <b>Do not use any info you got while you're a ghost in-game.</b></p>
		<p>Also, don't beg for the round to restart. It's not against the rules or anything, but your complaints will fall on deaf ears, and <a href="/ss14/who" class="secret">other people</a> won't care.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Uh, what the hell is a "Whisky Echo" something?</h2>
		<p>Good luck, agent.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Random question, but what job d-</h2>
		<p>Passenger, now let's get back to the guide.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Hey, this round's boring, why don-</h2>
		<p><b style="font-size: 2em">No.</b> Stop.</p>
		<p>Before you say ANYTHING, know that self-antagging (performing traitor-like things as a non-traitor) is a <b>bannable offense in practically every server.</b></p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>So uh, what's a passenger supposed to do?</h2>
		<p>Nothing.</p>
		<p>Literally, nothing. You're technically supposed to help people out, but no one does that, so.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Anything else?</h2>
		<p>Good luck, and have fun. Or, well, try to.</p>
