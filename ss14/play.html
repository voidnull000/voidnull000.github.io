		<h1>how 2: play ss14</h1>
		<h3>(note: don't take this guide as the "one true guide" for ss14, there's plenty of other things you need to be aware of that isn't covered here)</h3>
		<br>
		<p>So, you wanna play that one game that (some) people are talking about. Your first question is, probably:</p>
		<q>Uh, how DO I play SS14?</q>
		<p>Fret not! That's why this guide exists.</p><br>
		
		<h2>Hey, hasn't this been done before? Like, a load of times before?</h2>
		<p>Well, yeah, but I'm sure it hasn't been done like this.</p><br>
		<p>Actually no, that's a lie.</p>
		
		<h2>Part 1: So how DO I play SS14, then?</h2>
		<p>Step 1: Download the game</p>
		<p>This should be fairly easy if you know how a computer works.</p>
		<p>Head to <a href="https://spacestation14.io/">SS14's website</a>, and click the fairly large <b>Download Now!</b> button.</p>
		<p>You've now got 2 choices: (Well, okay, you have 4 choices, but only 2 will work for you.)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Join the Steam playtest</b>, or</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Download the launcher</b> for your platform.</p><br>
		<p>This might seem like a no-brainer at first, but there's a few things you need to know:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The launcher doesn't auto update by itself (which is stupid, honestly). The Steam playtest launcher, however, does.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The non-Steam launcher doesn't have anything to do with Steam, which is nice if you don't like supporting monopolies.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes a <b>LONG</b> time to get your Steam playtest copy.</p>
		<p>Also, note the other text on the page. Specifically:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need a <b>64 bit CPU and OS</b> at minimum.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 7 is <b>NOT</b> supported.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Part 2: I've got the launcher, now what?</h2>
		<p>You'll now need to make an account. Don't worry, it's not gonna ask for your Date Of Birth, your real name, nor the name of your grandmother.</p>
		<p>You'll only need to provide an email, for verification (and to stop spam-bots).</p>
		<p>Heck, it'll give you some other cool stuff, like:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access to the SS14 forums,</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...that's about it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Now, I can't really be bothered to make an account for this guide, but <b>hopefully</b> you'll be able to figure it out from the launcher.</p>
		<p>Once you've made an account, you should get a <b>verification email</b>, to activate it.</p>
		<p>If you haven't got it, then:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you've used the correct email (and made no typos)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Try resending the email (there's a button, it works)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Check your spam folder</p>
		<p>If all else fails, then it's time to join the discord server and ask for help. There's a link on <a href="https://spacestation14.io/">the website</a>, hopefully you can find it.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Help, the launcher isn't working!</h2>
		<p>Join the discord and ask for help. Hopefully they'll be able to solve the problem.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Part 3: I'm in! What now?</h2>
		<p>Click the <b>Servers</b> tab in the launcher. This'll give you a list of every server that's running at the moment.</p>
		<p>Then, find one that sounds cool, and click the <b>Connect</b> button.</p>
		<p>After a few seconds, you should be in game!</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Nope, not in game.</h2>
		<p>Join the discord, and ask for help. You're probably noticing a pattern by now.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Part 4: Okay, what NOW?</h2>
		<p>Now, you read the server's rules.</p>
		<p>Seriously, read them carefully. Not following them <b>WILL</b> get you banned.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Oh right, I should probably say something about RP types and stuff.</p>
		<p>SS14, at its heart, is a roleplay game. You're (probably) expected to roleplay a character, blah blah blah.</p>
		<p>There's 4 different RP types you need to know about:</p>
		<p><b>HRP</b>: Hard Roleplay, the strictest of the bunch. Follow the rules to a T, and make sure you read some more stuff, since it'll be important in your journey. Also, be prepared to roleplay. Seriously.</p>
		<p><b>MRP</b>: Medium Roleplay, a step down from HRP. It varies in how strict it is, but know that you're going to roleplay. Also, there's probably some other stuff to read, whatever.</p>
		<p><b>LRP</b>: Low Roleplay, unstrict and chaotic. "Unstrict", however, doesn't mean anarchy. There's still rules to follow, and a little bit of roleplay here and there. Just, don't be expected to have someone follow every important document.</p>
		<p><b>No RP</b>: Simple. You don't roleplay, everyone knows that they're playing a game, and everyone knows what means what. Very chaotic, but remember that it <b>is NOT anarchy. Follow the rules.</b></p>
		<br>
		<p>If you're playing SS14 for the first time, you're probably either gonna play LRP or No RP.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Uhhh, how do I control myself?</h2>
		<p>Quick rundown:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;W A S D - Move, like your favourite FPSes (I'm talking about Quake, obviously.)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;E - Interact with the object that's <b>under your mouse cursor</b></p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Q - Drop item in your hand</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Left click - Pick up item, open UIs</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Shift Left click - Examine, you'll be doing this a lot</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Right click - Context menu, a VERY important UI</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I - Inventory (actually, it's what you're wearing at the moment, but)</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;F1 - Admin Help</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Part 5: Hey, what's Admin Help for?</h2>
		<p>Glad you convieniently asked that after I mentioned AHelps in the previous paragraph.</p>
		<p>Admin Helps (also known as AHelps) are direct messages to the server's admins.</p>
		<p>A few things to note:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahelps are used for reporting bad behaviour</p>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahelps can also be used to request stuff, but <b>DON'T</b> expect to be taken seriously, or even listened to.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Part 6: Um, what job should I pick?!</h2>
		<p>Passenger. You should be picking Passenger.</p>
		<p>(Names can change between servers. <i>Passenger</i> can be <i>Assistant</i> on another server. There might not even be a Passenger role!)</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>But how do you play Passenger, I hear you asking?</p>
		<p>Well, that's what the <a href="/ss14/passenger">next guide</a> is for!</p>
