		<h1>how 2: do the whole "survival" thing</h1>
		<h3>(once again: this isn't a definitive guide. you should use a better guide if you want better information.)</h3>
		<br>
		
		<p>So, you want to survive for more then 1 minute.</p>
		<p>Uh, are we doing thi-</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Step 1: what the FUCK is space?</h2>
		<p>Space, for lack of a better term, is the area outside our atmosphere that holds nothing. Like, literally nothing.</p>
		<p>Because space is, well, space, there's no air. Since we're on a space station (hopefully), we need a way to make an atmosphere: This is atmospheric's (and thus, the engineer's) job, not yours, so don't worry about it.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Of course, pobody's nerfect, and atmos (and engineering) can fuck up. When this happens, you'll need 2 (maybe 3 if it's REALLY bad) items:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>an <b>oxygen tank</b>, to provide the air mixture in a portable format</li>
			<li>a <b>breath mask</b> (or gas mask), to take the air to your face, and into your lungs</li>
			<li>an EVA-capable suit, like the <b>EVA suit</b>, Emergency Hardsuit, etc., to allow the lack of pressure to not kill you.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Of course, this is over-simplifying it. Some species don't breath oxygen, and you might not need the suit.</p>
		<p>You'll need to activate the internals, too. It's an important distinction between "breathing the air around you" and "breathing the air in this tiny tank"</p>
		<p>It should be an action on your hotbar (1-9 buttons on your keyboard). It'll be the one with the gas mask in the corner of the icon.</p>
		<p>Or, you could also press the O2 icon on the right side of your screen, which <i>should</i> do the same.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Step 2: what's all this purple stuff that makes it hard to breathe?</h2>
		<p>If you've been around the station for a fair bit, you might've seen the air look a fair bit purple-ly.</p>
		<p>For obvious reasons, this isn't normal.</p>
		<p>This gas is known as <b>Plasma</b> <span class="small">(not to be confused with the 4th state of matter, science nerds)</span>, and it is VERY dangerous.</p>
		<p>If you ever see the air filled with a purple substance, evacuate the area <b>immediately</b>. It's very flammable, very toxic, and more importantly, <a class="secret" href="/ss14/lawsuit.html">a lawsuit waiting to happen</a>.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Step 3: hey, that green stuff looks cool!</h2>
		<p>Likewise, if you see a green substance in the air, <b>do not approach it</b>.</p>
		<p>That substance, named <b>Tritium</b>, is as dangerous as Plasma, if not more.</p>
		<p>Same advice above for this gas.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Step 4: why is someone trying to stab me?</h2>
		<p>If you ever get into a situation where you're being hurt, remember 3 rules:</p>
		<p>Rule 1: if you were the one that hurt someone, <b>you (probably) deserve it</b>.</p>
		<p>Rule 2: if the person trying to hurt you is a Security Officer, they're probably a dumbass. <b>Probably.</b></p>
		<p>Rule 3: if you're ever unsure, Ahelp. It won't hurt. Probably.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The only real tips I can give for fighting back are:</p>
		<ul><li>
			Run away.
		</ul></li>
		<p>Seriously, fighting in SS14 may as well be a simulation of what it feels like to be in a tumble dryer (for americans, I suppose "being in the middle of a football field" is a substitute).</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Step 5: The emergency shuttle has be-</h2>
		<p>If it's the end of the round, the emergency shuttle will probably be docked to the station.</p>
		<p>When that happens, you'll need to board it, less you get left behind when the cleanup operations begin.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Don't worry, all you need to do is to walk through the airlocks, onto the shuttle, and buckle yourself into a chair.</p>
		<p>The hard part is surviving the journey home.</p>
		<p>Again, don't worry. If you've learnt the above advice about internals and EVA gear, you'll be fine.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Probably.</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Step 6: i don't like taking public transport though!</h2>
		<p>If, for whatever reason, the shuttle is not an option, you can always use the new <b>escape pods</b>!</p>
		<p>First steps first, make sure your station actually has an escape pod. This is an exercise left to the reader, but pods should look like a tuna can with 2 tiles of space filled with seats.</p>
		<p>Next, make sure you're on the escape pod when the shuttle is docked. Buckling into a seat is preferred, but this tuna can has a size rating of infinity.</p>
		<p>Now, wait for the shuttle to depart, and your pod should automatically launch too.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Just, remember that you're not gonna dock anytime soon, so get comfy.</p>
		<p>Oh, and hope that one of the other people in your pod doesn't want to murder you. Or, all of the people inside the pod, for that matter.</p>
