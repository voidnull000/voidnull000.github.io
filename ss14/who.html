			Sometimes I feel like someone's watching me.<br>
			Not, like, someone's stalking me out of the corner of my eye.<br>
			Just, that someone's there, even if I know there isn't.<br>
			<br>
			Yeah, I know that's weird, but you've probably heard weirder shit.<br>
			...actually, I'll tell you something weirder.<br>
			<br>
			Sometimes, I hear someone speaking.<br>
			I don't know if it's the same person watching me, but I <i>swear</i> someone's saying something.<br>
			And every time, they're always going on about how I suck, or that I'm some "flukie" guy.<br>
			...<br>
			<br>
			Is anyone actually listening to me?<br>
			<br>
			...of course you weren't.<br>
			Fuck you too, buddy.<br>
