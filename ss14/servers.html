		<h1>how 2: be able to know what the differences between servers are</h1>
		<h3>(obviously, i'm shit at explaining things, so don't take this all seriously.)</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Huh, it's been a bit, hasn't it?</p>
		<!-- yeah me it's been literally months since you last did one of these jesus christ -->
		<p>...</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>Well whatever, let's just get on with it.</p>
		
		<!-- i dunno why but my brain instantly thinks "mawp" seeing this -->
		<h2>Part 1: what the hell is a merp?</h2>
		<p>A large part of SS14 is, of course, roleplay. But not everyone has the same tolerance for roleplay, and not everybody wants to roleplay anyway.</p>
		<p>So, in order to make everyone happy, everyone came up with some labels that typically cause arguments and is probably not a good idea in the long run.</p>
		<p>I uh, do not intend for that last statement to reflect any actual views, seriously.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So now introducing:</p>
		<h2>vnull's terrible guide to every RP type!</h2>
		<!-- ~~no rp fork when~~ -->
		<h3>First up, <b>No RP</b>!</h3>
		<p>No RP (which has a much more common acronym which I'm not using because it shares one with roleplay of a certain political party) is the roleplay type in which you just say "nah i don't feel like it" and don't roleplay.</p>
		<p>Typically servers without roleplay try to make up for it by adding in a load more game mechanics to make it more game-y.</p>
		<p>However, people typically hate no roleplay, and typically associate it with anarchy (which it isn't, there's still rules), or just call it plain bad.</p>
		<p>While, yes, this is a <b>roleplay</b> game, it's still a roleplay <b>game</b>, and you probably could have a lot more dumb fun without roleplay then with.</p>
		<p>YMMV, of course.</p>
		<br>
		<!-- "it's low rp whatever" they say, not knowing about the previous term -->
		<h3>Next, LRP!</h3>
		<p>With an image completely ruined by Wizard's Den Lizard (due to it's playerbase, it's <b>ALWAYS</b> the playerbase), low roleplay is where you're at least trying to roleplay.</p>
		<p>Typically having a tiny bit of roleplay, and a lot more gameplay, it usually is an okay-ish middle ground for those who actually want roleplay but also want to have some fun chaos.</p>
		<p>Speaking of middle grounds...</p>
		<br>
		<!-- so excited for this information -->
		<h3>MRP!</h3>
		<strike>just a week away just a week away just a week away just a week away just a week away just a week away </strike>
		<p>Medium roleplay is the halfway point between dumb fun and doing paperwork.</p>
		<p>If you actually want some REAL roleplay, but still want some funny chaos happening sometimes, MRP is (probably) for you.</p>
		<p>For those that actually want roleplay (or are just insane) though, we come to our final stop.</p>
		<br>
		<!-- bay12 has a pretty good "feeling" if you know what i mean, the problem i have with it is that, well, it's an HRP fork, you're expected to roleplay. -->
		<h3>Finally, HRP!</h3>
		<p>Fun fact: a large chunk of the SS14 devs prefer HRP, but it's not really that important.</p>
		<p>HRP is what you get when you think "man, i wish i was a different person entirely" and decide to do it in a video game.</p>
		<p>Typically involving a shit-load of rules, and some very strict administrators, HRP is not for the faint of heart.</p>
		<p>Of course, that never means people don't try, and people will <b>ALWAYS</b> try a hard thing, and some might even love it.</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>So, how was the utterly useless guide that explains literally nothing at all?</p>
		<p>Useless? Yeah, expected that.</p>
		<br>

		<h2>Part 2: the children yearn for the mines</h2>
		<p>"but wait!", I hear you say. "i just joined this random server, and it's completely different!"</p>
		<p>Well, first of all, (as of time of writing) most servers haven't really changed <i>that much</i>. Although, it IS worth saying that some servers have changed a fair amount of stuff to the point of being very different, gameplay-wise.</p>
		<p>Now, I'm biased, that you should know. I don't exactly play much, and I literally have never stepped foot in a server that doesn't speak english.</p>
		<p>However, I have other people who share the same braincell as I with experiences of these different servers. And while I've probably forgotten most of them, it's probably accurate enough that you can get an idea of how creative the community overall is right now.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So, here's my very biased and awful list of forks that I know of.</p>
		<table>
			<!-- still can't believe moony removed the cobble, literally 3149 -->
			<li>Afterlight 3149: You're on a ship in the middle of a giant debris field, and you gotta survive. Space is a bit more difficult to deal with, but you'll be fine, won't you?</li>
			<!-- i can't remember where i heard this from, either emo or rain, but i know i heard it. probably. -->
			<li>Stationware: Self described as a "shitter fork", the goal is to complete as many challenges as possible. Sounds simple, but there's other people trying to do the same, and they really don't like you.</li>
			<!-- i observed a single frigid round and it just looked terrible -->
			<li><strike>Frigid:</strike> Nope, sorry, rain is a moron who doesn't continue their forks. You'll never get to play this one.</li>
			<!-- blame beri for the automation comment, they REALLY like automation -->
			<li>Mining Station 14: After a very normal night at the Nanotrasen sponsored casino, you've lost all your money. In order to get it back, you'll need to mine ore in the safest conditions that corporate society has ever seen. Prepare to die. Oh, and automate a lot of stuff, apparently.</li>
			<li>Corvax: The russian fork, specialized in having some neat looking sprites and translating the entire game into russian. Very nice if you don't like speaking english, russians. At least, I'd think. <br>(psst, there's also other russian servers, but corvax is the first one i could think of. seriously, there's like 60 russian servers.</li>
			<!-- let's also never talk about why the skub sound has 3 different versions -->
			<li>Nyanotrasen: This one's dead, and let's not explain <i>why</i> it's dead, okay?</li>
			<!-- deltav is based off nyano, and thus inherits the shitcode. still not as bad as what hippy tried to do, seriously. -->
			<li>Delta-V: Also known as Nyanotrasen but better (by myself only), this one's the wacky fork. Loads of random features, hilarious gameplay (probably) and tons of shitcode.</li>
			<!-- does anyone remember robust paint -->
			<li><strike>Robust Pong: when is the next robust pong uptime please tell me my family is depending on this</strike></li>
			<!-- in one part i'm sorry pixel, in another fuck you pixel -->
			<li><strike>Combat Rim</strike>Thanatophobia (that's the word for, literally, "the fear of death"): Made by a shitcoder (sorry pixel, you just are), it's a fork of AL:3149 but more focused on combat. Or at least, that's the intended goal, since apparently it's now just Barotrauma? <br>JULY 2023 UPDATE: okay i don't even fucking know what it's supposed to be anymore</li>
		</table>
		<!-- pixel is quick to inform me that barotrauma sucks, to this i say "fuck off pixel, at least i had friends" -->
		<p class="small">by the way barotrauma had its 1.0 update recently you should go play it it's much more fun then ss14</p>
		<br>
		<p>Now obviously I'm missing servers, but I honestly don't play the game that much to know anymore differences, nor anymore servers.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>Part 3: NO ADMINS ALLOWED IN MY PLAY PEN</h2>
		<p>"wait wait wait" you're now saying. "what the hell is this server it looks odd" etc etc.</p>
		<p>So, fun fact, the hub has rules. There's a large guide to them which you can see on some webpage I don't feel like linking right now, but know that they exist and is a bit strict.</p>
		<p>Now, the hub is a very active place that needs constant moderation to make sure things are safe for work and easy to use. That means rules, and they need to constantly change.</p>
		<p>However, some rules which I'm probably sure will stay are:</p>
		<p>&nbsp;The server needs a language tag, like <code>[EN]</code> or <code>[RU]</code>.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;The server needs to mark if it's an 18+ server with <code>[+18]</code> or something similar.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;The server needs contact information, as in Discord contact information.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;The server needs to not mine cryptocurrency and anything related. No really, that's a rule. Should probably go without saying, honestly.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;And the obvious "no hate speech" rule.</p>
		
		<br>
		<p>So, if you want to be a good citizen on the hub, make sure you report that to someone on the SS14 discord. There's a link to it on the website.</p>
		<br><br>
		<!-- no lie, the gigabased server without rules was a recurring topic for a few days and it was always funny -->
		<p>But let's be real, "GIGABASED SERVER WITHOUT ADMINISTRATION" was a funny hub entry to see while it lasted.</p>
		<img style="width: 100%" src="Gigabased_server_SS14.png" alt="Said gigabased server as seen on the hub. It states the server as being low-rp, but we know that isn't happening." title="The only player is, presumably, the server owner. They're also probably not a good person. (thank you fey for the image)">
		<p>Obviously nobody joined it.</p>
