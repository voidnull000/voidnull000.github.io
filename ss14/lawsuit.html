		<p>It's... insane.</p>
		<p>It's insane how they can get away with all this shit.</p>
		<br>
		<p>...what? No, this isn't some bullshit about some random group of people, it's about,</p>
		<p>y'know? You DO know who I'm talking about, right?</p>
		<br>
		<p>...ugh, anything to dodge the response, then.</p>
		<p>Nanotrasen. I'm talking about your employer, Nanotrasen.</p>
		<p>It's literally just...</p>
		<br>
		
		<i>*sigh</i>
		<p>Look. I'll give you examples. I'll give you 2. Figure out the rest.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Okay, where to begin.</p>
		<p>2549. Your ol' pals at NT decide that it's time for some cleanups.</p>
		<p>...no, I don't know why they wanted to do that. I don't work there.</p>
		<p>But, they decide to clean a few stains off of their perfectly clean window.</p>
		<p>They shove a few homeless people from the streets into some advanced hardsuits, give them powerful guns that just-</p>
		<br>
		<p>No, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY HOMELESS, OKAY.</p>
		<p>Ugh, whatever.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Okay, they send a bunch of mentally unstable people with guns on a shuttle, direct to SS12.</p>
		<br>
		<p>...yeah. That's what that shooting was. That's what I'm implying.</p>
		<p>They just decided to cull a few workers, employees, and blame it on some random terrorists.</p>
		<p>All 'cuz they couldn't legally fire someone randomly.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>...I promised a second example? Huh.</p>
		<p>Must be my memory, huh?</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>Okay, uhh...</p>
		<p>2554, SS14. We had-</p>
		<br><br>
		<p>...because I worked there, you idiot. How else would I have known?!</p>
		<p>Argh.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So, our captain had just made a really shitty announcement. Like, literally "dictator of the station" level of shit.</p>
		<p>...no, I don't know how he got hired, just that he was there. Can you STOP interrupting me?!</p>
		<p>But, then everything went, well, lights-off. Emergency lights only, and they were glowing ORANGE.</p>
		<p>Yeah, the one for Delta alert. Except it wasn't Delta, it was "Epsilon", or whatever.</p>
		<br>
		
		<p>...we're out of time? This was being timed?!</p>
		<p>Oh, my brig time's done. Nevermind.</p>
