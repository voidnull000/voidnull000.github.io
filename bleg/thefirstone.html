				Hi.
				
				Considering how many *other people* that I know have blogs now, I've decided that I should also do one of those.
				
				Soo. What now?
				
				Well, I guess an actual introduction is needed. If you care.
				I'm voidnull. People sometimes call me (in text) "void" but frankly, I prefer being called "null", since it just sounds better.
				...
				That's it, basically.
				
				Also, yes, this text isn't aligned.
				Whoever made the pre element for HTML is an idiot.
				
				I'll probably just do this better soon since I can't be bothered right now.
				Or ever.
