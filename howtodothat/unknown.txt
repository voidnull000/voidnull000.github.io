okay listen
as someone who has 4 fingers i can do some pretty cool stuff
sadly that cool stuff usually involves eating some type of rock for an hour
i don't remember when i was taught all of this crap (i don't want to remember honestly it was really boring)
but i know how to do it cause *SOMEBODY* keeps telling me to
at least there's such a thing as a knockout fling so i don't have to listen to that constantly

oh yeah also
like, should probably be obvious by now
but, um, we aren't from earth
if the floating hands and body made of crystal didn't make it obvious
personally i think europa is pretty cool but everyone on earth gives me compliments on how nice i look so
i don't know it's a tight competition
i know lebb's favourite is mercury but that's probably because she's interested in the constant explosion in space
i mean, that's how it was described to her, but now she only knows it as that and it's been a pain

oh man the keyboard's sokein agin
