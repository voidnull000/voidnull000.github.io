		<p id="lebb">Have you ever had one of THOSE days when you've really needed to open your window wide open, but for some reason it's stuck and can't open?</p>
		<p id="ry">uh no, i regularly call engineers to fix them, but go ahead</p>
		<p id="lebb">Well, allow me to help you with this easy, quick, and simple guide to opening your window!</p>
		
		<br><br>
		<h2>Step 1: Grab the window's glass</h2>
		<p id="lebb">Unsurprisingly, the first step is pretty simple. Take the glass on your window, hold tight, and pull it REAL hard.</p>
		<p id="ry">you know nobody makes a glass pane with an embedded handle right</p>
		<p id="lebb">Yeah they do, I order from them all the time!</p>
		<p id="ry"><i style="font-size: 11px">how many glass panes do you go through</i></p>
		<br>
		<p id="lebb">Now, pane in hand, just put it to one side. We'll need it later.</p>
		<h2>Step 2: Disassemble the frame</h2>
		<p id="ry"><i style="font-size: 11px">how much skill do you think i have lebb</i></p>
		<br>
		<p id="lebb">This only requires a hammer, a chisel, and some awareness of your hand.</p>
		<p id="lebb">All you need is to put the chisel on the frame, put the hammer on top, and...</p>
		<h3 style="font-style: italic">*BONK</h3>
		<p id="lebb">There, all done!</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<p id="ry">so uh, how are you gonna close it</p>
		<p id="lebb">Isn't that what the glass pane is for?</p>
		<p id="ry">where does it go lebb</p>
		<p id="ry">what do you put it in now</p>
		<p>...</p>
		<p id="lebb">I mean, I have this pot here...</p>
		<br>
		<p id="ry">i suppose a guide to closing your window is out of the question</p>
		<p id="lebb">Why would you ever want to close a window!?</p>
		<p id="ry">plenty of reasons including rain, nuclear fallout, and glass snow</p>
		<p id="lebb">That's what the house is for!</p>
		<p id="ry">next you're gonna light it on fire, knowing you</p>
		
		<br>
		<p id="offscreen">Hey, you know we're still rolling, right?</p>
		<p id="offscreen">Film's expensive and you need to cut this off now.</p>
		<p id="lebb">SO. That concludes our first episode of How 2 Do That!</p>
		<p id="ry">and we've already broken something important</p>
		<p id="ry">this is not gonna end well is it</p>
