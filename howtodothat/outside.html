		<h1>how 2 go outside</h1>
		<h3>with your hosts (again): <span id="lebb">Lebb</span> and <span id="ry">Ry</span></h3>
		<br><br>
		
		<p id="lebb">Have you ever needed to get outside suddenly, either for some fresh air or because someone set the building on fire?</p>
		<p id="ry">you really need to stop doing that, by the way</p>
		<p id="lebb"><i style="font-size: 11px">Nevermind that.</i></p>
		<p id="lebb">Well, here's a quick and easy guide to going outside!</p>
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Step 1: Obtain the needed equipment</h2>
		<p id="lebb">All we need for this are some common materials that you can find in any store.</p>
		<list id="lebb">
			These are:
			<li style="margin-left: 1em">Marking tape (or markers, if you prefer!)</li>
			<li style="margin-left: 1em">A screwdriver</li>
			<li style="margin-left: 1em">A sledgehammer</li>
			<li style="margin-left: 1em">Some high-explosive</li>
		</list>
		<br>
		<p id="lebb">Of course, you may find it a bit tricky to get a sledgehammer.</p>
		<p id="ry"><i style="font-size: 11px">last time you said that you were recommending people to get a firearm</i></p>
		<p id="lebb">Well, it's very easy to get one if you make sure to purchase our new book:</p>
		<h3 id="lebb">Lebb's guide to obtaining a sledgehammer (100% legal and safe advice!) (Buy now!)</h3>
		<p id="lebb">The details shouldn't need to be said again on here, of course.</p>
		<p id="ry">it's a hundred pages of lebb telling you how to commit various crimes that has nothing to do with sledgehammers</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Step 2: Identifying a proper exit point</h2>
		<p id="lebb">Now that we have all our ingredients, we can start making our doorway.</p>
		<p id="lebb">Of course, the first step is to find a place where the door can go.</p>
		<p id="lebb">This is easy enough, however.</p>
		<p id="lebb">All you need to do is find the nearest window, fire exit sign, or fusebox!</p>
		<p id="lebb">All of those (especially combined) are perfect positions for a new door!</p>
		<br>
		<p id="lebb">Next, use the marking tape (or the markers) to mark out the size of the doorway.</p>
		<p id="lebb">I've found that the perfect size for your doorways are around 5 meters, all sides.</p>
		<p id="ry">or you could measure the doors in the building, like a normal person</p>
		<p id="lebb"><i style="font-size: 11px">Don't overcomplicate more things then necessary, Ry!</i></p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Step 3: The doorway</h2>
		<p id="lebb">The rest of the mission is very simple.</p>
		<p id="lebb">First, use the hammer to break a hole, large enough for the HE to fit inside.</p>
		<p id="lebb">Next, screw the HE inside the hole.</p>
		<p id="lebb">And, finally...</p>
		<h1 style="font-size: 5em; font-style: italic">*KABLOOM</h1>
		<br><br><br>
		
		<p id="lebb">And there you have it!</p>
		<p id="ry">the entire wall is gone</p>
		<p id="lebb">Well, we did what was needed, didn't we?</p>
		<p id="ry">don't involve me in this please</p>
		<br>
		<p id="offscreen">Okay, cut, cut.</p>
		<p id="offscreen">What the hell are you two doing?!</p>
		<p id="lebb">Uh, our jobs? <span id="ry">property damage</span></p> 
		<p id="offscreen">Jesus.</p>
		<p id="offscreen">Don't destroy the set anymore then you've already done.</p>
		<i id="offscreen">[whispers something]</i> <!-- Why do we even hire these two idiots? -->
		
		<br><br>
		<p id="lebb">Well, I suppose that brings the end to today's episode of-</p>
		<p id="ry">you are not getting me to say it with you</p>
		<p id="ry">also thanks for covering me in dust</p>
		<!-- little did she know that it was asbestos -->
		<!-- actually why would she care anyway -->
